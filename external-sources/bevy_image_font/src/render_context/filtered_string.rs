//! A module for filtering strings based on a character map.
//!
//! This module provides the [`FilteredString`] type, which offers a reusable
//! and efficient abstraction for working with strings filtered according to a
//! predefined character map. This is particularly useful in scenarios where
//! only a subset of characters are supported, such as rendering text with an
//! `ImageFont`.
//!
//! # Key Features
//! - **Efficient Filtering:** Filters strings without unnecessary allocations,
//!   making it suitable for performance-sensitive contexts.
//! - **Iterator Support:** Allows iteration over filtered characters for
//!   further processing.
//! - **Display Implementation:** Can be directly converted to a string
//!   representation of the filtered content.
//!
//! # Usage
//! This module is typically used in conjunction with image font rendering
//! systems, where only characters supported by the font's atlas are allowed. It
//! ensures unsupported characters are ignored while preserving the order of the
//! valid characters.
